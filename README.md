# Fileservice
**Fileservice** is a secure microservice for uploading, downloading, and streaming files.<br><br>
It uses AES encryption to protect file contents at rest, and supports organizing files into logical collections and can optionally integrate with an authentication microservice for user-based access control.
<br><br><br>

## Features
- AES-256 encryption for all file contents
- File upload, download, and streaming support
- Collection-based file organization
- Optional JWT-based user authentication via external Authservice
- Ready-to-run Docker environment
- Postman collection for testing and exploration
<br><br><br>

## Technology Stack
- Java 17
- Spring Boot
- PostgreSQL
- Docker & Docker Compose
- JPA (Hibernate)
- JUnit 5
<br><br><br>

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Java 17+ (for development or test execution outside Docker)
<br><br>

### Running the Application
Clone the repository and start the service using Docker Compose:

```
git clone https://github.com/StrangeQuark/fileservice.git
cd fileservice
docker-compose up --build
```
<br><br>

### Environment Variables
The `.env` file is required to provide necessary configuration such as encryption secrets and database credentials. Default values are provided in `.env` file so the application can run out-of-the-box for testing.

⚠️ **Warning**: Do not deploy this application to production without properly changing your environment variables. The provided `.env` is not safe to use past local deployments!
<br><br>

## API Documentation
A Postman collection is included in the root of the project:

- `FileService.postman_collection.json`

This collection provides examples for:
- Creating and listing collections
- Uploading files to a collection
- Downloading or streaming files
- Authenticating requests (if using Authservice)
<br><br>

## Testing
Unit tests are provided for all repository and service-layer logic.
<br><br>

## Deployment
This project includes a `Jenkinsfile` for use in CI/CD pipelines. Jenkins must be configured with:

- Docker support
- Secrets or environment variables for configuration
- Access to any relevant private repositories, if needed
<br><br>

## Optional: Authservice Integration
Fileservice can integrate with a separate Authservice microservice to support JWT-based authentication and per-user file access control.

To enable this:
- Forward the `Authorization` header to Fileservice (usually handled by an API gateway).
- Use valid JWT tokens generated by Authservice.
